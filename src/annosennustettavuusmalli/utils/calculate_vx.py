    This function computes the volume receiving a dose at least as high as X Gray (Gy) for

    of the total organ volume.

    Args:
        dose_tensor (torch.Tensor): A tensor representing the dose distribution.
        mask_tensor (torch.Tensor): A tensor of the same shape as dose_tensor, where each
            element's value corresponds to an organ identifier.
        config (dict): A mapping from organ names (str) to their corresponding mask values (int).
        threshold (float): The dose level (in Gray) for which to calculate the volume percentages.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are organ names and values are the percentages of
        each organ's volume that receive at least the dose threshold.
